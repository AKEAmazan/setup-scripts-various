# setup-scripts-various
Documenting the setup process for servers I use. Ultimately creating provisioning scripts for servers.

## Install Kobo Toolbox on a cloud server using the script in this repo:
- Get a domain name from a vendor (I used NameCheap but use whatever you like).
- Configure the domain on the vendor's site to use your hosting provider's nameserver (well, do this: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-point-to-digitalocean-nameservers-from-common-domain-registrars).
- Spin up a new Ubuntu 16.04, minimum 2GB of RAM (it won't work with less).  I used Digital Ocean $20/month droplet, but you can use Amazon AWS, RackSpace, Linode, or whatever.
- configure the DNS on your hosting provider's site to connect your domain name to your server (well, do this: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-a-host-name-with-digitalocean)
- wait until the DNS propagates (likely not more than a day, in my experience usually a few hours)
- Log into your server, create a user with sudo privileges, and ssh into the new user (well, do this: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-connect-to-your-droplet-with-ssh and this: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/initial-server-setup-with-ubuntu-16-04)
- Run the following commands: 

`git clone https://github.com/ivangayton/setup-scripts-various.git`

`cd setup_scripts_various`

`./kobotoolbox_secured_server_docker_install`

- Answer the questions my script asks you:
 - domain name (the one you got from the vendor), username and password for your initial Kobo user (that they will use to log in to your server), and support email address; do try to type all of these accurately)
- Provide the script with the sudo password for the user account on the server
- Answer the questions on the LetsEncrypt dialogue that the script will launch (your email address and your agreement to the ToS)
- Wait while a bunch of gobbledygook whizzes by, hopefully ending with a message suggesting that you try out your new server
- Give it a minute for the server to actually initialize
- Sit back and enjoy Kobo goodness.
