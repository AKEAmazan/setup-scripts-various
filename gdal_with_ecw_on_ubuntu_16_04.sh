# This is a script to install GDAL 2.2.1 with ERDAS ECW file format support
# in Ubuntu 16.04.
# This is purely a quick convenience hack. GDAL versions will change and
# this script will quickly become obsolete, not to mention the fact that it
# depends on some external files being available on the KyngChaos site!
